# # Week 4: Multi-class Classification
# 
# Welcome to this assignment! In this exercise, you will get a chance to work on a multi-class classification problem. You will be using the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the english alphabet. 
# 
# You will need to pre-process the data so that it can be fed into your convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.
# 
# 

import csv
import string
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, array_to_img
import os


# This line is added
TRAINING_FILE = 'W4_Data/sign_mnist_train.csv'

# Unlike previous assignments, you will not have the actual images provided, instead you will have the data serialized as `csv` files.
# 
# Take a look at how the data looks like within the `csv` file:


with open(TRAINING_FILE) as training_file:
    line = training_file.readline()
    print(f"First line (header) looks like this:\n{line}")
    line = training_file.readline()
    print(f"Each subsequent line (data points) look like this:\n{line}")


# As you can see, each file includes a header (the first line) and each subsequent data point is represented as a line that contains 785 values. 
# 
# The first value is the label (the numeric representation of each letter) and the other 784 values are the value of each pixel of the image. Remember that the original images have a resolution of 28x28, which sums up to 784 pixels.

#  ## Parsing the dataset
#  
#  Now complete the `parse_data_from_input` below.
# 
#  This function should be able to read a file passed as input and return 2 numpy arrays, one containing the labels and one containing the 28x28 representation of each image within the file. These numpy arrays should have type `float64`.
# 
#  A couple of things to keep in mind:
#  
# - The first line contains the column headers, so you should ignore it.
# 
# - Each successive line contains 785 comma-separated values between 0 and 255
#   - The first value is the label
# 
#   - The rest are the pixel values for that picture
# 
#   
# **Hint**:
# 
# You have two options to solve this function. 
#   
#    - 1. One is to use `csv.reader` and create a for loop that reads from it, if you take this approach take this into consideration:
# 
#         - `csv.reader` returns an iterable that returns a row of the csv file in each iteration.
#     Following this convention, row[0] has the label and row[1:] has the 784 pixel values.
# 
#         - To reshape the arrays (going from 784 to 28x28), you can use functions such as [`np.array_split`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array_split.html) or [`np.reshape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html).
# 
#         - For type conversion of the numpy arrays, use the method [`np.ndarray.astype`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html).
# 
# 
#    - 2. The other one is to use `np.loadtxt`. You can find the documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html).
#    
#    
# Regardless of the method you chose, your function should finish its execution in under 1 minute. If you see that your function is taking a long time to run, try changing your implementation.

# GRADED FUNCTION: parse_data_from_input

    """

    Args:
    filename (string): path to the CSV file

    Returns:
    images, labels: tuple of numpy arrays containing the images and labels
    """
    with open(filename) as file:


        # Use csv.reader, passing in the appropriate delimiter
        # Remember that csv.reader can be iterated and returns one line in each iteration

        # YOUR CODE HERE


        return images, labels

TRAIN_SPLIT = 0.99

# **Expected Output:**

# ## Visualizing the numpy arrays
# 
# Now that you have converted the initial csv data into a format that is compatible with computer vision tasks, take a moment to actually see how the images of the dataset look like:

# Plot a sample of 10 images from the training set
def plot_categories(training_images, training_labels):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(16, 15))
    axes = axes.flatten()
    letters = list(string.ascii_lowercase)

    for k in range(10):
        img = training_images[k]
        img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=-1)
        img = array_to_img(img)
        ax = axes[k]
        ax.imshow(img, cmap="Greys_r")
        ax.set_title(f"{letters[int(training_labels[k])]}")
        ax.set_axis_off()

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_categories(training_images, training_labels)


# ## Creating the generators for the CNN
# 
# Now that you have successfully organized the data in a way that can be easily fed to Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`, it is time for you to code the generators that will yield batches of images, both for training and validation. For this complete the `train_val_generators` function below.
# 
# Some important notes:
# 
# - The images in this dataset come in the same resolution so you don't need to set a custom `target_size` in this case. In fact, you can't even do so because this time you will not be using the `flow_from_directory` method (as in previous assignments). Instead you will use the [`flow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator#flow) method.
# - You need to add the "color" dimension to the numpy arrays that encode the images. These are black and white images, so this new dimension should have a size of 1 (instead of 3, which is used when dealing with colored images). Take a look at the function [`np.expand_dims`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html) for this.

# ## Coding the CNN
# 
# One last step before training is to define the architecture of the model that will be trained.
# 
# Complete the `create_model` function below. This function should return a Keras' model that uses the `Sequential` or the `Functional` API.
# 
# The last layer of your model should have a number of units that corresponds to the number of possible categories, as well as the correct activation function.
# 
# Aside from defining the architecture of the model, you should also compile it so make sure to use a `loss` function that is suitable for multi-class classification.
# 
# **Note that you should use no more than 2 Conv2D and 2 MaxPooling2D layers to achieve the desired performance.**
